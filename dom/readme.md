# DOM module (`delphidom`)
Implements the Document Object Model outlined by the Delphi API.
  
The purpose of this module is simply to implement the DOM itself,
the rendering, resource loading, session handling and such is not
the responsibility of this module.
  
This module also implements the SAX parser handler that parses
documents.
